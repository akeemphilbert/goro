Feature: Performance Requirements
  As a pod user
  I want efficient data access
  So that my applications perform well even with large datasets

  Background:
    Given the storage system is running
    And the pod storage is available

  Scenario: Sub-second response times for frequent data
    Given I have stored frequently accessed RDF data
    When I retrieve the resource multiple times
    Then each response should be under 1 second
    And the response time should be consistent

  Scenario: Efficient streaming for large files
    Given I have a large binary file of 50MB
    When I upload the file using streaming
    Then the upload should complete efficiently
    And memory usage should remain bounded
    When I download the file using streaming
    Then the download should start immediately
    And memory usage should remain bounded

  Scenario: Concurrent access handling
    Given I have stored multiple resources
    When 10 clients access different resources simultaneously
    Then all requests should complete successfully
    And response times should remain acceptable
    And no resource conflicts should occur

  Scenario: Efficient indexing for fast lookups
    Given I have stored 1000 resources
    When I search for a specific resource by ID
    Then the lookup should complete in under 100ms
    And the system should use efficient indexing

  Scenario: Resource prioritization under load
    Given the system is under heavy load
    And I have both active and background requests
    When resources become constrained
    Then active requests should be prioritized
    And background requests should be queued appropriately
    And system stability should be maintained

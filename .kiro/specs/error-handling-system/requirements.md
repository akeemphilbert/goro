# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Error Handling System provides comprehensive error management, logging, and user-friendly error responses for the Solid pod. This feature ensures that all errors are properly caught, logged, and communicated to clients with appropriate HTTP status codes and meaningful error messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want meaningful error responses so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix issues in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
2. WHEN providing error details THEN the system SHALL include clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN errors have context THEN the system SHALL provide relevant debugging information
4. WHEN multiple errors exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and report the most critical ones
5. IF errors contain sensitive information THEN the system SHALL sanitize responses for security

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want comprehensive error logging so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
2. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL include request context and stack traces
3. WHEN categorizing errors THEN the system SHALL use appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
4. WHEN errors are critical THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
5. IF log storage becomes full THEN the system SHALL rotate logs and maintain recent error history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want graceful error handling so that temporary issues don't cause data loss or system crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery
2. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and integrity
3. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
4. WHEN errors cascade THEN the system SHALL prevent error propagation from causing system failure
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL preserve user data and allow safe recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want error monitoring so that I can detect potential security threats and system abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security-relevant error details
2. WHEN suspicious patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert security personnel
3. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL log and monitor abuse attempts
4. WHEN access violations occur THEN the system SHALL record detailed security audit information
5. IF attack patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL implement automatic protective measures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured error handling so that I can programmatically process error responses in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning errors THEN the system SHALL use consistent error response formats
2. WHEN providing error codes THEN the system SHALL use standard HTTP status codes appropriately
3. WHEN errors need categorization THEN the system SHALL include machine-readable error types
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide correlation IDs for error tracking
5. IF error formats change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing clients

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LDP (Linked Data Platform) Compliance system implements the W3C Linked Data Platform specification to ensure the Solid pod follows standard protocols for managing linked data resources. This feature provides the foundation for interoperability with other Solid pods and LDP-compliant applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Solid application developer, I want LDP-compliant resource management so that my applications work with any Solid pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL implement LDP BasicContainer specifications
2. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL follow LDP resource creation protocols
3. WHEN updating resources THEN the system SHALL support LDP-compliant PATCH operations
4. WHEN deleting resources THEN the system SHALL handle LDP deletion semantics correctly
5. IF LDP operations are invalid THEN the system SHALL return standard LDP error responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want standard resource types so that different applications can understand and work with my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating containers THEN the system SHALL support LDP BasicContainer and DirectContainer types
2. WHEN managing membership THEN the system SHALL maintain proper LDP membership relations
3. WHEN organizing data THEN the system SHALL support nested container hierarchies
4. WHEN accessing resources THEN the system SHALL provide proper LDP type information
5. IF resource types conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts according to LDP specifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTTP method support so that I can perform all necessary LDP operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using GET requests THEN the system SHALL return LDP resources with proper headers
2. WHEN using POST requests THEN the system SHALL create new resources in containers
3. WHEN using PUT requests THEN the system SHALL replace resources completely
4. WHEN using PATCH requests THEN the system SHALL support partial resource updates
5. IF HTTP methods are used incorrectly THEN the system SHALL return appropriate LDP error codes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want LDP metadata so that applications can discover resource capabilities and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving resources THEN the system SHALL include proper LDP headers (Link, Allow, etc.)
2. WHEN containers are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide membership information
3. WHEN resources change THEN the system SHALL update container membership automatically
4. WHEN querying metadata THEN the system SHALL support HEAD requests for resource information
5. IF metadata is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL detect and repair inconsistencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a standards-compliant developer, I want full LDP specification support so that advanced LDP features work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL support LDP paging for large containers
2. WHEN managing constraints THEN the system SHALL enforce LDP resource constraints
3. WHEN handling conflicts THEN the system SHALL implement proper LDP conflict resolution
4. WHEN versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL support LDP versioning mechanisms
5. IF LDP compliance is tested THEN the system SHALL pass standard LDP test suites

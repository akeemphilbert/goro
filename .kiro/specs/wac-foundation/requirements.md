# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Access Control (WAC) Foundation system implements the core access control mechanisms for the Solid pod, enabling users to define who can access their resources and what operations they can perform. This feature provides the security foundation for all data access in the pod.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to control who can access my data so that I can maintain privacy and share information selectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL enforce access control policies
2. WHEN access is requested THEN the system SHALL verify permissions before allowing operations
3. WHEN permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden with clear reasons
4. WHEN access control fails THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
5. IF no access control is defined THEN the system SHALL apply secure default permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a resource owner, I want to grant different permission levels so that I can give appropriate access to different people and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting permissions THEN the system SHALL support Read, Write, Append, and Control access modes
2. WHEN granting access THEN the system SHALL allow permissions for specific users, groups, or public access
3. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL support time-limited and conditional access
4. WHEN permissions conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using secure precedence rules
5. IF permission changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate and apply them immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WAC-compliant access control so that my Solid applications work with standard permission systems.

#### Access Criteria

1. WHEN implementing access control THEN the system SHALL follow W3C Web Access Control specifications
2. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL use standard WAC vocabulary and predicates
3. WHEN serving ACL resources THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable access control information
4. WHEN access is evaluated THEN the system SHALL support WAC inheritance and delegation patterns
5. IF WAC compliance is tested THEN the system SHALL pass standard WAC test suites

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want access control monitoring so that I can audit permissions and detect unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log all permission checks with outcomes
2. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL record detailed security audit information
3. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL log permission modifications with user context
4. WHEN analyzing security THEN the system SHALL provide access control reports and analytics
5. IF suspicious access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and apply protective measures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want efficient permission checking so that access control doesn't significantly impact system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL complete authorization in milliseconds
2. WHEN permissions are frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL cache authorization decisions appropriately
3. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN access control SHALL not become a performance bottleneck
4. WHEN permission structures are complex THEN the system SHALL optimize evaluation algorithms
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain security while optimizing permission checking

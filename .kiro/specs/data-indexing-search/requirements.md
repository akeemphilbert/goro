# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Indexing & Search system provides efficient indexing and search capabilities for large datasets within the Solid pod. This feature enables fast data discovery, full-text search, and optimized query performance to support responsive applications even with extensive data collections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user with large datasets, I want fast search capabilities so that I can quickly find specific information without waiting for slow queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for data THEN the system SHALL provide sub-second response times for most queries
2. WHEN indexing content THEN the system SHALL support full-text search across RDF literals and binary file content
3. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL support fuzzy matching, stemming, and synonym expansion
4. WHEN search results are returned THEN they SHALL be ranked by relevance and include result snippets
5. IF search queries are complex THEN the system SHALL provide query suggestions and auto-completion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible indexing options so that I can optimize search performance for my application's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring indexing THEN the system SHALL support selective indexing of specific properties and resource types
2. WHEN managing indexes THEN the system SHALL provide options for real-time vs. batch indexing strategies
3. WHEN customizing search THEN the system SHALL support custom analyzers and tokenizers for different data types
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide index statistics and optimization recommendations
5. IF indexing requirements change THEN the system SHALL support index rebuilding and migration without downtime

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want efficient resource usage so that indexing doesn't consume excessive storage or processing power.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building indexes THEN the system SHALL optimize storage usage and compression
2. WHEN processing updates THEN the system SHALL use incremental indexing to minimize resource consumption
3. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL provide configurable limits for index size and update frequency
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL throttle indexing operations to maintain responsiveness
5. IF storage becomes limited THEN the system SHALL provide options to prioritize and prune less important indexes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want secure search so that indexing and search operations respect my access control settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing content THEN the system SHALL respect access control policies and only index accessible content
2. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user permissions
3. WHEN sharing search capabilities THEN the system SHALL ensure users can only search content they can access
4. WHEN managing indexes THEN the system SHALL update indexes when permissions change
5. IF unauthorized search attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log security events and deny access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want search APIs so that I can integrate powerful search functionality into my Solid applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building search interfaces THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for search operations
2. WHEN implementing search THEN the system SHALL support various query syntaxes (simple, advanced, SPARQL-based)
3. WHEN handling results THEN the system SHALL provide pagination, sorting, and filtering options
4. WHEN integrating search THEN the system SHALL support search result highlighting and faceted search
5. IF search performance needs optimization THEN the system SHALL provide query analysis and performance tuning tools

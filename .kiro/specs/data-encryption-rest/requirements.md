# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Encryption at Rest system provides comprehensive encryption of stored data within the Solid pod, ensuring that user information remains protected even if storage systems are compromised. This feature implements strong encryption standards and secure key management to protect data confidentiality and integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious pod user, I want my data encrypted at rest so that it remains protected even if someone gains unauthorized access to the storage systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all user data using strong encryption algorithms (AES-256 or equivalent)
2. WHEN encrypting files THEN the system SHALL support both RDF resources and binary files with appropriate encryption methods
3. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL decrypt content transparently for authorized users
4. WHEN encryption fails THEN the system SHALL reject storage operations and maintain data security
5. IF encryption keys are unavailable THEN the system SHALL prevent data access and alert administrators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want secure key management so that encryption keys are properly protected and managed throughout their lifecycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing keys THEN the system SHALL use secure key generation with cryptographically strong random sources
2. WHEN storing keys THEN the system SHALL protect encryption keys using key encryption keys (KEK) or hardware security modules
3. WHEN rotating keys THEN the system SHALL support key rotation without data loss or service interruption
4. WHEN backing up keys THEN the system SHALL provide secure key backup and recovery mechanisms
5. IF key compromise is suspected THEN the system SHALL support emergency key rotation and re-encryption procedures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want encryption compliance so that the pod meets regulatory requirements for data protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing encryption THEN the system SHALL use FIPS-approved or equivalent encryption standards
2. WHEN managing compliance THEN the system SHALL provide encryption status reporting and audit capabilities
3. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL support different encryption levels based on data classification
4. WHEN demonstrating compliance THEN the system SHALL provide encryption verification and compliance reports
5. IF compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt encryption policies to meet new standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want transparent encryption so that applications can work with encrypted data without needing to handle encryption details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN encryption and decryption SHALL be transparent to applications and users
2. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide APIs that handle encryption automatically
3. WHEN managing performance THEN encryption SHALL not significantly impact application response times
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for encryption-related issues
5. IF encryption impacts functionality THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options to balance security and performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want encryption monitoring so that I can ensure encryption is working correctly and detect any security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring encryption THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing encryption status and key health
2. WHEN tracking performance THEN the system SHALL monitor encryption overhead and optimization opportunities
3. WHEN detecting issues THEN the system SHALL alert administrators about encryption failures or key problems
4. WHEN auditing security THEN the system SHALL log all encryption operations and key management activities
5. IF encryption systems fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and recovery procedures

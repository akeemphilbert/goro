# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Resource Metadata & Headers system provides comprehensive HTTP header management and resource discovery capabilities for the Solid pod. This feature ensures proper metadata exposure, caching support, and resource introspection to enable efficient client-server communication and resource management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTTP headers so that my applications can understand resource characteristics and handle caching correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving resources THEN the system SHALL include accurate Content-Type headers
2. WHEN resources have known sizes THEN the system SHALL provide Content-Length headers
3. WHEN supporting caching THEN the system SHALL generate and validate ETags for resources
4. WHEN content changes THEN the system SHALL update Last-Modified headers appropriately
5. IF headers are missing THEN clients SHALL still be able to process resources with degraded functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want efficient resource access so that my applications load quickly and use minimal bandwidth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources support caching THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate Cache-Control headers
2. WHEN conditional requests are made THEN the system SHALL support If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since
3. WHEN resources haven't changed THEN the system SHALL return 304 Not Modified responses
4. WHEN caching is inappropriate THEN the system SHALL set no-cache or no-store directives
5. IF cache validation fails THEN the system SHALL serve fresh content with updated headers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Solid application developer, I want resource discovery metadata so that my applications can understand resource types and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving RDF resources THEN the system SHALL include Link headers for type information
2. WHEN containers are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide LDP type and membership information
3. WHEN resources have relationships THEN the system SHALL expose relevant link relations
4. WHEN serving binary files THEN the system SHALL include appropriate MIME type information
5. IF metadata is complex THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential information in headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want CORS and security headers so that my browser applications can access resources safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving cross-origin requests THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CORS headers
2. WHEN security is important THEN the system SHALL provide security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
3. WHEN handling preflight requests THEN the system SHALL expose allowed methods and headers
4. WHEN serving sensitive content THEN the system SHALL include appropriate security directives
5. IF security headers conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most restrictive safe settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want header monitoring so that I can ensure proper metadata delivery and troubleshoot client issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving requests THEN the system SHALL log header generation and validation events
2. WHEN header errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track header processing overhead
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive header inspection capabilities
5. IF header policies change THEN the system SHALL validate new configurations before applying them

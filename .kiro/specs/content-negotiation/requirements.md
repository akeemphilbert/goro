# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Negotiation system enables clients to request data in their preferred formats and representations. This feature implements HTTP content negotiation standards to support multiple RDF serializations, language preferences, and encoding options, ensuring interoperability across diverse Solid applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to request RDF data in my preferred format so that my application can process it efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting RDF resources THEN the system SHALL support Accept header negotiation
2. WHEN multiple formats are acceptable THEN the system SHALL choose the best match based on quality values
3. WHEN serving RDF data THEN the system SHALL support Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, and N-Triples formats
4. WHEN no acceptable format exists THEN the system SHALL return 406 Not Acceptable
5. IF format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL return 500 Internal Server Error with details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want content encoding support so that large resources transfer efficiently over slow connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients support compression THEN the system SHALL provide gzip and deflate encoding
2. WHEN serving large resources THEN the system SHALL automatically compress responses when beneficial
3. WHEN Accept-Encoding is specified THEN the system SHALL respect client preferences
4. WHEN compression is not supported THEN the system SHALL serve uncompressed content
5. IF encoding fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to uncompressed delivery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an international user, I want language negotiation so that I can receive content in my preferred language when available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources have multiple language versions THEN the system SHALL support Accept-Language negotiation
2. WHEN serving multilingual content THEN the system SHALL choose the best language match
3. WHEN no preferred language is available THEN the system SHALL serve the default language version
4. WHEN language metadata exists THEN the system SHALL include Content-Language headers
5. IF language negotiation fails THEN the system SHALL serve content in the primary language

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTTP headers so that my application can understand the content characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL include accurate Content-Type headers
2. WHEN content is negotiated THEN the system SHALL include Vary headers for caching
3. WHEN serving resources THEN the system SHALL provide Content-Length when known
4. WHEN content changes THEN the system SHALL update ETag values for cache validation
5. IF headers are missing THEN clients SHALL still be able to process the content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want efficient negotiation so that content selection doesn't impact performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing negotiation THEN the system SHALL complete selection in milliseconds
2. WHEN caching is possible THEN the system SHALL cache negotiated content appropriately
3. WHEN serving popular formats THEN the system SHALL optimize for common Accept headers
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN negotiation SHALL not become a bottleneck
5. IF negotiation is complex THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms for format selection

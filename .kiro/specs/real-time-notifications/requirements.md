# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-time Notifications system provides WebSocket-based live updates for Solid pod resources, enabling applications to receive immediate notifications when data changes. This feature supports real-time collaboration, live data synchronization, and responsive user experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time notifications when data changes so that my applications can stay synchronized with the latest information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources change THEN the system SHALL send notifications to subscribed clients via WebSocket
2. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket handshake and authentication
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN they SHALL include resource URI, change type, and timestamp information
4. WHEN connections fail THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
5. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for retry or provide catch-up mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want to subscribe to specific resources so that I only receive notifications for data I care about.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN subscribing THEN users SHALL be able to specify individual resources or container patterns for notifications
2. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL support subscription creation, modification, and cancellation
3. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL update subscriptions to respect new access controls
4. WHEN subscriptions are active THEN the system SHALL only send notifications for resources the user can access
5. IF subscription limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want secure notifications so that real-time updates don't compromise data privacy or system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL authenticate users and validate permissions
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL filter content based on user access rights
3. WHEN handling connections THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL terminate connections and log security events
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny connections and alert administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want reliable notification delivery so that my applications don't miss important data changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connections are stable THEN notifications SHALL be delivered in near real-time (sub-second latency)
2. WHEN connections are interrupted THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to catch up on missed notifications
3. WHEN notifications are critical THEN the system SHALL support delivery confirmation and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN handling high volumes THEN the system SHALL maintain notification ordering and prevent message loss
5. IF delivery guarantees cannot be met THEN the system SHALL provide fallback polling mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want notification monitoring so that I can manage system resources and troubleshoot connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing active WebSocket connections and subscriptions
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track notification delivery metrics and latency
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs of connection events and notification delivery
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of WebSocket connections
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement connection limits and graceful degradation

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SPARQL Query Support system enables complex querying and data discovery within the Solid pod using the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language. This feature provides powerful data access capabilities for applications that need to perform sophisticated queries across RDF resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to query RDF data using SPARQL so that my applications can perform complex data discovery and analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing SPARQL queries THEN the system SHALL support SPARQL 1.1 query language features
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, and DESCRIBE query forms
3. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL return results in standard formats (JSON, XML, CSV, TSV)
4. WHEN queries are invalid THEN the system SHALL return clear syntax error messages
5. IF queries are too complex THEN the system SHALL provide timeout protection and resource limits

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want secure SPARQL access so that queries respect my privacy settings and access controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL enforce access control policies on all queried resources
2. WHEN query results include restricted data THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user permissions
3. WHEN unauthorized queries are attempted THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden with clear explanations
4. WHEN queries span multiple resources THEN the system SHALL check permissions for each accessed resource
5. IF permission checking fails THEN the system SHALL deny the query and log the security event

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want efficient SPARQL execution so that my queries perform well even on large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing queries THEN the system SHALL optimize query execution plans for performance
2. WHEN querying large datasets THEN the system SHALL support result pagination and streaming
3. WHEN queries are frequently used THEN the system SHALL cache query results appropriately
4. WHEN concurrent queries run THEN the system SHALL manage resources to prevent performance degradation
5. IF queries are slow THEN the system SHALL provide query performance analysis and optimization suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want federated SPARQL queries so that I can query across multiple pods and data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying external sources THEN the system SHALL support SPARQL federation with SERVICE clauses
2. WHEN accessing remote endpoints THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and authorization properly
3. WHEN federation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about remote access issues
4. WHEN combining data sources THEN the system SHALL maintain query performance across federated queries
5. IF remote endpoints are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and continue with available data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want SPARQL monitoring so that I can track query usage and optimize system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL log query performance metrics and resource usage
2. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide reports on query patterns and frequency
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL identify slow queries and suggest improvements
4. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL provide controls for query limits and timeouts
5. IF query abuse is detected THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and alert administrators

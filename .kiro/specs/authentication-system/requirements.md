# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication System provides secure user authentication for the Solid pod using WebID-OIDC (OpenID Connect) and other standard authentication methods. This system enables users to securely log in using their WebID while supporting session management, token validation, and multi-factor authentication options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to authenticate using my WebID so that I can securely access my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support WebID-OIDC protocol
2. WHEN login is requested THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate identity provider
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
5. IF WebID is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject authentication with 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want secure session management so that user sessions are properly maintained and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL generate cryptographically secure tokens
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
3. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all session tokens
4. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify token integrity and expiration
5. IF session tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want multiple authentication options so that I can choose the most secure method for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support multiple identity providers
2. WHEN enhanced security is needed THEN the system SHALL support multi-factor authentication
3. WHEN using different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent authentication experience
4. WHEN authentication methods change THEN the system SHALL support method migration
5. IF primary authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication APIs so that my applications can integrate with the pod's authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication endpoints
2. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL provide token validation APIs
3. WHEN handling authentication flows THEN the system SHALL support standard OAuth2/OIDC patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard HTTP authentication error codes
5. IF API usage is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want authentication monitoring so that I can track login attempts and security events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication attempts occur THEN the system SHALL log all login events with timestamps
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
3. WHEN analyzing security THEN the system SHALL provide authentication metrics and reports
4. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails for authentication events
5. IF security breaches are suspected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed forensic information

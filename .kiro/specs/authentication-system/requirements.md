# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication System provides secure user authentication for the Solid pod using WebID-OIDC (OpenID Connect) and other standard authentication methods. This system enables users to securely log in using their WebID while supporting session management, token validation, and multi-factor authentication options.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to authenticate using my WebID so that I can securely access my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support WebID-OIDC protocol
2. WHEN login is requested THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate identity provider
3. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL create a secure session
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
5. IF WebID is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject authentication with 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want secure session management so that user sessions are properly maintained and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL generate cryptographically secure tokens
2. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
3. WHEN users log out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all session tokens
4. WHEN session validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify token integrity and expiration
5. IF session tampering is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want multiple authentication methods including optional MFA so that I can choose the most appropriate security level for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support username and password authentication
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support WebID-OIDC authentication
3. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support third-party OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
4. WHEN enhanced security is desired THEN the system SHALL support optional multi-factor authentication (MFA)
5. WHEN using MFA THEN the system SHALL support TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) as a second factor
6. WHEN using different devices THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent authentication experience across all methods
7. IF primary authentication method fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative authentication options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication APIs so that my applications can integrate with the pod's authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide clear authentication endpoints
2. WHEN checking authentication status THEN the system SHALL provide token validation APIs
3. WHEN handling authentication flows THEN the system SHALL support standard OAuth2/OIDC patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard HTTP authentication error codes
5. IF API usage is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to create a new WebID using external identity providers so that I can easily onboard without manual WebID setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering with external identity THEN the system SHALL create a new WebID automatically
2. WHEN using Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL support Google as an identity provider
3. WHEN WebID creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL link the external identity to the new WebID
4. WHEN external identity is already linked THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate WebID creation
5. IF external identity verification fails THEN the system SHALL reject registration with clear error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a logged-in pod user, I want to link additional external identities to my WebID so that I can use multiple authentication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authenticated user requests identity linking THEN the system SHALL verify current session
2. WHEN linking external identity THEN the system SHALL support OAuth2/OIDC flows
3. WHEN linking succeeds THEN the system SHALL store the association securely
4. WHEN identity is already linked THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate associations
5. IF linking fails THEN the system SHALL maintain existing authentication state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure token management so that authentication tokens are properly secured and rotated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
2. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive token data at rest
3. WHEN tokens approach expiration THEN the system SHALL support automatic refresh flows
4. WHEN security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL support immediate token revocation
5. IF token validation fails THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As someone deploying the pod, I want to configure external identity provider credentials so that I can integrate with OAuth providers securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL support client ID configuration via environment variables
2. WHEN configuring OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL support client secret configuration via environment variables
3. WHEN using secret management systems THEN the system SHALL support specifying secret keys for external secret providers
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages during startup
5. IF credentials are missing THEN the system SHALL disable the corresponding authentication provider gracefully

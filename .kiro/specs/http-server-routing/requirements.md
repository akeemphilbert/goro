# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HTTP Server & Basic Routing feature provides the foundational web server infrastructure for the Solid pod server. This feature establishes the core HTTP handling capabilities that all other Solid protocol features will build upon, including request routing, middleware support, and basic HTTP compliance. The implementation will use Kratos v2.8.0 framework to accelerate development while maintaining clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns across domain, application, and infrastructure layers.


## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want a robust HTTP server that can handle incoming requests so that users and applications can interact with my Solid pod over the web.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL listen on a configurable port (default 8080)
2. WHEN an HTTP request is received THEN the server SHALL route it to the appropriate handler
3. WHEN the server encounters an error THEN it SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL support HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols
5. IF the server receives a malformed request THEN it SHALL return a 400 Bad Request response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer building Solid applications, I want the pod server to follow HTTP standards so that my applications can reliably communicate with it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the server SHALL support standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
2. WHEN returning responses THEN the server SHALL include appropriate HTTP headers
3. WHEN handling OPTIONS requests THEN the server SHALL return supported methods for the resource
4. WHEN processing HEAD requests THEN the server SHALL return the same headers as GET but without the body
5. IF a request uses an unsupported method THEN the server SHALL return 405 Method Not Allowed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want flexible request routing so that different types of resources and operations can be handled appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request matches a defined route THEN the server SHALL execute the corresponding handler
2. WHEN no route matches a request THEN the server SHALL return 404 Not Found
3. WHEN defining routes THEN the system SHALL support path parameters and wildcards
4. WHEN multiple routes could match THEN the server SHALL use the most specific match
5. IF route handlers need to be modified THEN the system SHALL support dynamic route registration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want middleware support so that cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and CORS can be handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the server SHALL execute middleware in the correct order
2. WHEN middleware encounters an error THEN it SHALL be able to halt request processing
3. WHEN middleware completes successfully THEN the request SHALL continue to the next middleware or handler
4. WHEN configuring the server THEN middleware SHALL be composable and reusable
5. IF middleware needs request/response modification THEN it SHALL have access to both objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want proper logging and monitoring so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor server health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are processed THEN the server SHALL log request details (method, path, status, duration)
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the server SHALL log error details with appropriate severity levels
3. WHEN the server starts or stops THEN it SHALL log lifecycle events
4. WHEN logging is configured THEN it SHALL support different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
5. IF log output needs to be structured THEN the server SHALL support JSON logging format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want graceful shutdown capabilities so that active connections are handled properly during server restarts or maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shutdown signal is received THEN the server SHALL stop accepting new connections
2. WHEN shutting down THEN the server SHALL wait for active requests to complete within a timeout period
3. WHEN the timeout is reached THEN the server SHALL forcefully close remaining connections
4. WHEN shutdown is initiated THEN the server SHALL log the shutdown process
5. IF critical resources need cleanup THEN the server SHALL execute cleanup handlers before exit

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the HTTP server to follow clean architecture principles so that the codebase is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing server components THEN the system SHALL separate concerns across domain, application, and infrastructure layers
2. WHEN defining interfaces THEN domain interfaces SHALL be defined in the domain layer with implementations in infrastructure
3. WHEN handling dependencies THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection via Google Wire
4. WHEN writing code THEN it SHALL follow Go conventions and be covered by unit tests
5. IF external dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be abstracted behind domain interfaces

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable server settings so that the server can be adapted to different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the server THEN it SHALL load configuration from YAML files and environment variables
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the server SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
3. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the server SHALL use sensible defaults
4. WHEN TLS is enabled THEN the server SHALL support HTTPS with configurable certificates
5. IF configuration changes THEN the server SHALL validate settings before applying them

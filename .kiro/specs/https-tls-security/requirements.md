# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The HTTPS/TLS Security system provides encrypted communication channels for all pod interactions, ensuring data privacy and integrity during transmission. This feature implements modern TLS standards, certificate management, and security best practices to protect user data and authentication credentials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want encrypted connections so that my data is protected during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to the pod THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS for all communications
2. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.2 or higher
3. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL encrypt all request and response content
4. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN the system SHALL redirect to HTTPS automatically
5. IF TLS negotiation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the connection with appropriate errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want proper certificate management so that users can trust the security of my pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving HTTPS THEN the system SHALL use valid SSL/TLS certificates
2. WHEN certificates expire THEN the system SHALL support automatic renewal
3. WHEN certificate validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use trusted certificate authorities
4. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL include proper security headers
5. IF certificates are invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent insecure connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want strong cryptographic standards so that the pod meets modern security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring TLS THEN the system SHALL use strong cipher suites and disable weak ones
2. WHEN negotiating encryption THEN the system SHALL prefer forward secrecy cipher suites
3. WHEN handling certificates THEN the system SHALL support both RSA and ECDSA key types
4. WHEN establishing connections THEN the system SHALL implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
5. IF weak cryptography is detected THEN the system SHALL reject connections and log security events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want security monitoring so that I can ensure ongoing protection and detect security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TLS connections are made THEN the system SHALL log connection security details
2. WHEN certificate events occur THEN the system SHALL monitor certificate validity and expiration
3. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
4. WHEN auditing security THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive TLS usage reports
5. IF security standards are not met THEN the system SHALL prevent operation until issues are resolved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible TLS configuration so that I can adapt security settings to different deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the pod THEN the system SHALL support configurable TLS settings
2. WHEN using development environments THEN the system SHALL support self-signed certificates with warnings
3. WHEN integrating with load balancers THEN the system SHALL support TLS termination configurations
4. WHEN updating security THEN the system SHALL allow cipher suite and protocol version configuration
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide clear error messages

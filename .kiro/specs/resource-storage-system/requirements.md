# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Resource Storage System provides the core data storage capabilities for the Solid pod server, enabling storage and retrieval of both RDF (structured) and binary (unstructured) data. This system implements the foundational storage layer that all Solid protocol operations depend on, supporting multiple RDF serialization formats and efficient file management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want to store RDF data in multiple formats so that applications can work with their preferred serialization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing RDF data THEN the system SHALL support Turtle, JSON-LD, and RDF/XML formats
2. WHEN retrieving RDF data THEN the system SHALL return data in the requested format via content negotiation
3. WHEN converting between formats THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic meaning and data integrity
4. WHEN format conversion fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. IF an unsupported RDF format is requested THEN the system SHALL return 406 Not Acceptable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to store binary files like images and documents so that I can manage all my data in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading binary files THEN the system SHALL store them without modification
2. WHEN retrieving binary files THEN the system SHALL return the exact original content
3. WHEN storing files THEN the system SHALL preserve original MIME types and metadata
4. WHEN file storage fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with details
5. IF storage space is insufficient THEN the system SHALL return 507 Insufficient Storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want efficient data access so that my applications perform well even with large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing frequently used data THEN the system SHALL provide sub-second response times
2. WHEN storing large files THEN the system SHALL support streaming uploads and downloads
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL use efficient indexing for fast lookups
4. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the system SHALL handle multiple simultaneous operations
5. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize active requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want data integrity guarantees so that user data is never corrupted or lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL verify write operations completed successfully
2. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent serving corrupted data
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
4. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL restore data to a consistent state
5. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the operation and log the error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean storage API so that I can easily integrate storage operations into applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the storage API THEN it SHALL provide clear methods for CRUD operations
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the API SHALL return meaningful error messages and codes
3. WHEN performing operations THEN the API SHALL be consistent across different data types
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the API SHALL support pluggable storage backends
5. IF operations are invalid THEN the API SHALL validate inputs and return clear errors

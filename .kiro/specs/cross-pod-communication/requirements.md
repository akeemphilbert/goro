# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Cross-pod Communication system enables interoperability between different Solid pods, allowing users to share data, collaborate, and access resources across pod boundaries. This feature implements the protocols and security measures necessary for secure inter-pod communication and data federation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Solid user, I want to access resources on other pods so that I can collaborate with users who have different pod providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing external pods THEN the system SHALL support standard Solid protocol communication
2. WHEN authenticating with remote pods THEN the system SHALL use WebID-OIDC for cross-pod authentication
3. WHEN requesting remote resources THEN the system SHALL respect remote pod access control policies
4. WHEN remote access fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about connectivity or permission issues
5. IF remote pods are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully and provide appropriate fallbacks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want to control external access to my pod so that I can manage who can connect from other pods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external pods connect THEN the system SHALL validate incoming requests and authentication
2. WHEN managing external access THEN the system SHALL support allowlists and blocklists for remote pods
3. WHEN cross-pod requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce local access control policies
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and security measures
5. IF external access policies change THEN the system SHALL update enforcement immediately and notify affected connections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want federated data access so that my applications can seamlessly work with data across multiple pods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide APIs for discovering and accessing remote resources
2. WHEN handling federated queries THEN the system SHALL support SPARQL federation across multiple pods
3. WHEN caching remote data THEN the system SHALL respect remote pod caching policies and invalidation
4. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts and maintain data consistency
5. IF federation complexity increases THEN the system SHALL provide tools to manage and monitor federated operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want cross-pod security monitoring so that I can detect and prevent malicious inter-pod activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-pod communication occurs THEN the system SHALL log all inter-pod requests and responses
2. WHEN analyzing security THEN the system SHALL monitor for suspicious patterns in cross-pod access
3. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL implement automatic protective measures
4. WHEN investigating incidents THEN the system SHALL provide detailed audit trails of cross-pod activities
5. IF security threats are identified THEN the system SHALL coordinate with other pods to share threat intelligence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want efficient cross-pod operations so that working with remote data feels seamless and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing remote resources THEN the system SHALL optimize network requests and minimize latency
2. WHEN working with remote data THEN the system SHALL provide intelligent caching and prefetching
3. WHEN connections are slow THEN the system SHALL provide progressive loading and offline capabilities
4. WHEN synchronizing changes THEN the system SHALL use efficient delta synchronization protocols
5. IF network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL adapt communication strategies to maintain usability

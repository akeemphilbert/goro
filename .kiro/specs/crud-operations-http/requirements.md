# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CRUD Operations via HTTP system provides the core data manipulation capabilities for the Solid pod, implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through standard HTTP methods. This feature enables applications to manage user data through RESTful APIs while maintaining data integrity and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create resources via HTTP POST so that my applications can add new data to the pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posting to containers THEN the system SHALL create new resources with generated URIs
2. WHEN creating resources THEN the system SHALL validate content type and format
3. WHEN resources are created THEN the system SHALL return 201 Created with Location header
4. WHEN creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes with details
5. IF container doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to read my data via HTTP GET so that applications can retrieve and display my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting resources THEN the system SHALL return content with proper HTTP headers
2. WHEN resources exist THEN the system SHALL support conditional requests with ETags
3. WHEN content negotiation is used THEN the system SHALL return data in requested format
4. WHEN resources don't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found
5. IF access is denied THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden with clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update resources via HTTP PUT and PATCH so that applications can modify existing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PUT THEN the system SHALL replace the entire resource content
2. WHEN using PATCH THEN the system SHALL support partial updates with SPARQL Update or JSON Patch
3. WHEN updates succeed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate success codes (200 or 204)
4. WHEN update conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent modification properly
5. IF update format is invalid THEN the system SHALL return 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to delete resources via HTTP DELETE so that I can remove unwanted data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deleting resources THEN the system SHALL remove them completely from storage
2. WHEN deleting containers THEN the system SHALL handle contained resources appropriately
3. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL return 204 No Content
4. WHEN resources don't exist THEN the system SHALL return 404 Not Found
5. IF deletion is not allowed THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTTP semantics so that my applications behave predictably and follow web standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are idempotent THEN the system SHALL ensure repeated operations have same effect
2. WHEN using HTTP methods THEN the system SHALL follow proper REST semantics for each method
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standard HTTP status codes with meaningful messages
4. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption and race conditions
5. IF operations are unsafe THEN the system SHALL require appropriate HTTP methods and validation

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The WebID Implementation provides the core identity system for the Solid ecosystem, enabling users to have decentralized, globally unique identifiers. This feature implements the WebID specification to create and manage user identities that can be used across different Solid pods and applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want a unique WebID so that I can be identified across the Solid ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a WebID THEN the system SHALL generate a unique HTTP(S) URI identifier
2. WHEN accessing a WebID THEN the system SHALL return a valid RDF profile document
3. WHEN WebID is requested THEN the system SHALL include essential profile information
4. WHEN WebID format is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject creation with clear errors
5. IF WebID already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate creation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want WebID profile documents so that applications can discover user information and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serving WebID profiles THEN the system SHALL include FOAF (Friend of a Friend) vocabulary
2. WHEN profiles are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable RDF data
3. WHEN profile information changes THEN the system SHALL update the WebID document
4. WHEN multiple formats are requested THEN the system SHALL support content negotiation
5. IF profile data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to manage my profile information so that I can control what others see about me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating profiles THEN users SHALL be able to modify name, email, and other basic information
2. WHEN managing privacy THEN users SHALL control which profile fields are public or private
3. WHEN linking accounts THEN users SHALL be able to add social media and other identifiers
4. WHEN profile changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate data before saving
5. IF unauthorized changes are attempted THEN the system SHALL reject them with 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want WebID discovery so that other systems can find and verify user identities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebIDs are created THEN the system SHALL make them discoverable via well-known endpoints
2. WHEN identity verification is needed THEN the system SHALL provide cryptographic proof mechanisms
3. WHEN cross-pod communication occurs THEN WebIDs SHALL be resolvable from external systems
4. WHEN serving WebID documents THEN the system SHALL include proper HTTP headers and metadata
5. IF WebID resolution fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want WebID integrity so that my identity cannot be spoofed or tampered with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebIDs are created THEN the system SHALL ensure uniqueness and prevent conflicts
2. WHEN serving WebID documents THEN the system SHALL include integrity verification mechanisms
3. WHEN WebID ownership is questioned THEN the system SHALL provide proof of control
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events
5. IF WebID tampering is attempted THEN the system SHALL prevent unauthorized modifications

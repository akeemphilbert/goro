# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Chrome browser extension that can detect microformats on web pages and allow users to save them to their Solid pod. The extension will provide a seamless way for users to collect structured data from websites they visit and store it in their personal data pod using their WebID for authentication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web user, I want to install a Chrome extension that can detect microformats on any webpage, so that I can identify structured data available for collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL appear in the Chrome toolbar with an appropriate icon
2. WHEN I visit a webpage containing microformats THEN the extension SHALL automatically detect them in the background
3. WHEN microformats are detected THEN the extension icon SHALL show a visual indicator (badge or color change)
4. WHEN no microformats are found THEN the extension SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Solid pod user, I want to authenticate with my WebID through the extension, so that I can securely access my personal data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the extension icon THEN it SHALL display a login interface
2. WHEN I enter my WebID URL THEN the extension SHALL validate the format
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the extension SHALL store the session securely
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the extension SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN I am authenticated THEN the extension SHALL display my WebID and provide a logout option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user browsing websites, I want to see a list of detected microformats on the current page, so that I can choose which data to save to my pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the extension popup THEN it SHALL display all detected microformats on the current page
2. WHEN microformats are found THEN each SHALL be displayed with its type (hCard, hEvent, hProduct, etc.)
3. WHEN I select a microformat THEN it SHALL show a preview of the structured data
4. WHEN multiple instances of the same microformat type exist THEN they SHALL be listed separately
5. WHEN no microformats are detected THEN it SHALL display "No microformats found on this page"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Solid pod owner, I want to save selected microformats to my pod as RDF resources, so that I can build a personal collection of structured data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a microformat and click "Save to Pod" THEN it SHALL convert the data to RDF format
2. WHEN saving to the pod THEN it SHALL use appropriate RDF vocabularies (vCard, Schema.org, etc.)
3. WHEN the save is successful THEN it SHALL display a confirmation message
4. WHEN the save fails THEN it SHALL display an error message with details
5. WHEN saving THEN it SHALL organize resources in appropriate containers based on microformat type

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want the extension to only access data when I explicitly use it, so that my browsing activity remains private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL only request necessary permissions
2. WHEN I visit a page THEN it SHALL only scan for microformats when the popup is opened
3. WHEN authentication data is stored THEN it SHALL use Chrome's secure storage APIs
4. WHEN I logout THEN it SHALL clear all stored authentication data
5. WHEN the extension is uninstalled THEN it SHALL not leave any persistent data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user managing my data collection, I want to see the status of my saved microformats, so that I can track what I've already collected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a microformat that I've already saved THEN it SHALL show a "Previously saved" indicator
2. WHEN I attempt to save a duplicate THEN it SHALL warn me and offer to update or skip
3. WHEN viewing my collection THEN it SHALL provide a link to view saved resources in my pod
4. WHEN saving fails due to network issues THEN it SHALL offer to retry the operation

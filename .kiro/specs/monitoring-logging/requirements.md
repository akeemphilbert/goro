# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Monitoring & Logging system provides comprehensive observability, performance tracking, and operational insights for the Solid pod. This feature enables administrators to monitor system health, track performance metrics, and maintain detailed logs for troubleshooting and compliance purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want comprehensive system monitoring so that I can ensure the pod is running smoothly and detect issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the system THEN it SHALL track key performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network usage)
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send alerts and notifications
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL provide real-time dashboards and historical trend analysis
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and suggest optimizations
5. IF critical issues are detected THEN the system SHALL escalate alerts and provide automated remediation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed application logs so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL capture detailed information with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN structuring logs THEN the system SHALL use consistent formats with correlation IDs for request tracking
3. WHEN managing log volume THEN the system SHALL support log rotation, compression, and retention policies
4. WHEN searching logs THEN the system SHALL provide powerful search and filtering capabilities
5. IF log storage becomes full THEN the system SHALL manage storage automatically and alert administrators

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want security monitoring so that I can detect and respond to potential threats and unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring security THEN the system SHALL track authentication events, access patterns, and permission changes
2. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL generate security alerts and incident reports
3. WHEN analyzing threats THEN the system SHALL provide security dashboards and threat intelligence integration
4. WHEN investigating incidents THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed audit trails and forensic capabilities
5. IF security breaches are suspected THEN the system SHALL support automated response and containment measures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want usage analytics so that I can understand how the pod is being used and make informed decisions about resources and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking usage THEN the system SHALL monitor user activity, resource access patterns, and feature utilization
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide usage statistics and trend analysis
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL correlate usage patterns with system performance metrics
4. WHEN planning capacity THEN the system SHALL provide growth projections and resource planning recommendations
5. IF usage patterns change significantly THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest adjustments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want audit logging so that I can demonstrate compliance with regulations and maintain proper records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maintaining compliance THEN the system SHALL log all data access, modifications, and administrative actions
2. WHEN generating audit reports THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive audit trails with tamper-evident logging
3. WHEN managing retention THEN the system SHALL support configurable retention periods and secure log archival
4. WHEN investigating compliance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports and evidence for regulatory audits
5. IF compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt logging and reporting to meet new standards

**User Story:** As a non-technical pod user, I want an intuitive interface to manage who can access my data so that I can control privacy without needing technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing permissions THEN the system SHALL provide a visual interface for setting access controls
2. WHEN selecting users THEN the system SHALL support user search and selection from contacts or WebID directories
3. WHEN setting permissions THEN the system SHALL use clear, non-technical language for permission types
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback on permission effects
5. IF permission conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight conflicts and suggest resolutions

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing resources THEN the system SHALL display current effective permissions clearly
2. WHEN permissions are inherited THEN the system SHALL show the inheritance chain and sources
3. WHEN permissions are complex THEN the system SHALL provide simplified summaries of access rights
4. WHEN troubleshooting access THEN the system SHALL provide permission resolution explanations
5. IF permissions seem incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on how to fix them

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want bulk permission management so that I can efficiently manage access for multiple resources and users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing multiple resources THEN the system SHALL support bulk permission operations
2. WHEN working with groups THEN the system SHALL provide group management interfaces
3. WHEN applying templates THEN the system SHALL support permission templates for common scenarios
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL show preview of changes before applying them
5. IF bulk operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reports of successes and failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want permission monitoring dashboards so that I can oversee access control across the entire pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring access THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing permission usage and patterns
2. WHEN analyzing security THEN the system SHALL highlight potential security issues and overly permissive settings
3. WHEN auditing permissions THEN the system SHALL provide reports on who has access to what resources
4. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed access logs and permission history
5. IF security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and recommended actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want responsive permission management so that I can manage access controls from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the permission interface SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN managing permissions on small screens THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential controls and information
3. WHEN connectivity is limited THEN the system SHALL support offline permission viewing and queued changes
4. WHEN switching devices THEN permission management state SHALL sync across devices
5. IF mobile limitations exist THEN the system SHALL provide alternative access methods for complex operations

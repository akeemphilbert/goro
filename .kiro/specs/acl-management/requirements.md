# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ACL (Access Control List) Management system provides fine-grained permission management capabilities for Solid pod resources. This feature enables users to create, modify, and manage detailed access control policies with support for individual users, groups, and complex permission scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a resource owner, I want to create detailed access control lists so that I can specify exactly who can do what with my resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating ACLs THEN the system SHALL support Read, Write, Append, and Control permissions
2. WHEN defining access THEN the system SHALL allow permissions for specific WebIDs, groups, and public access
3. WHEN setting up ACLs THEN the system SHALL support resource-specific and default permissions
4. WHEN ACL creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors and guidance
5. IF ACL syntax is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the ACL and maintain existing permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want group-based permissions so that I can easily manage access for teams and organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing groups THEN the system SHALL support group creation and membership management
2. WHEN granting group access THEN permissions SHALL apply to all current and future group members
3. WHEN group membership changes THEN the system SHALL update effective permissions immediately
4. WHEN groups are nested THEN the system SHALL handle hierarchical group permissions correctly
5. IF group resolution fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the resolution failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want conditional access controls so that I can implement advanced security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting conditions THEN the system SHALL support time-based access restrictions
2. WHEN implementing policies THEN the system SHALL support IP address and location-based restrictions
3. WHEN using applications THEN the system SHALL support application-specific permissions
4. WHEN conditions change THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate access permissions dynamically
5. IF conditions are not met THEN the system SHALL deny access and provide clear explanations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want ACL inheritance so that permission management scales efficiently across large resource hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers have ACLs THEN child resources SHALL inherit permissions by default
2. WHEN inheritance is used THEN the system SHALL support permission overrides at any level
3. WHEN ACL changes occur THEN the system SHALL propagate changes through the inheritance hierarchy
4. WHEN resolving permissions THEN the system SHALL combine inherited and explicit permissions correctly
5. IF inheritance creates conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them using secure precedence rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ACL management APIs so that applications can programmatically manage permissions on behalf of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful APIs for ACL management
2. WHEN modifying ACLs THEN the system SHALL validate permissions and syntax before applying changes
3. WHEN querying permissions THEN the system SHALL provide APIs to check effective permissions for resources
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information for debugging
5. IF API usage is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and examples for correct usage

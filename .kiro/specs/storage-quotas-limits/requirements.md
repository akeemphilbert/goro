# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Storage Quotas & Limits system provides resource management and usage controls for the Solid pod, enabling administrators to set storage limits, monitor usage, and ensure fair resource allocation among users. This feature helps maintain system sustainability and prevents resource abuse.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want to set storage quotas so that I can manage resource usage and ensure fair allocation among users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting quotas THEN the system SHALL support configurable storage limits per user and per resource type
2. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL track storage consumption in real-time and provide usage reports
3. WHEN quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL prevent new uploads and notify users of quota violations
4. WHEN managing limits THEN the system SHALL support different quota tiers and temporary quota increases
5. IF quota enforcement fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain quota integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to see my storage usage so that I can manage my data efficiently and stay within my allocated limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking usage THEN users SHALL see current storage consumption and remaining quota
2. WHEN approaching limits THEN the system SHALL provide warnings before quotas are exceeded
3. WHEN managing data THEN users SHALL see storage usage breakdown by resource type and container
4. WHEN optimizing usage THEN the system SHALL suggest ways to reduce storage consumption
5. IF usage calculations are incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to recalculate and correct usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want quota APIs so that my applications can check limits and handle quota-related errors gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide APIs to query current quota usage and limits
2. WHEN uploading data THEN the system SHALL check quotas before accepting uploads and return appropriate errors
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL return specific quota-related HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN monitoring usage THEN applications SHALL be able to subscribe to quota usage notifications
5. IF quota checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms and clear error reporting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want flexible quota management so that I can adapt resource allocation to changing needs and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adjusting quotas THEN the system SHALL support dynamic quota changes without service interruption
2. WHEN managing policies THEN the system SHALL support quota inheritance and group-based quota management
3. WHEN analyzing usage THEN the system SHALL provide quota utilization analytics and optimization recommendations
4. WHEN handling growth THEN the system SHALL support automatic quota scaling based on usage patterns
5. IF quota policies conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using configurable precedence rules

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want quota monitoring so that I can detect abuse and ensure system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring quotas THEN the system SHALL track quota violations and unusual usage patterns
2. WHEN abuse is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement protective measures
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL provide quota usage reports and capacity planning insights
4. WHEN managing security THEN the system SHALL support quota-based rate limiting and abuse prevention
5. IF system resources are threatened THEN the system SHALL implement emergency quota restrictions and alerts

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Basic CORS Support system enables web applications running in browsers to access the Solid pod by implementing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. This feature provides the necessary HTTP headers and preflight request handling to allow secure cross-origin access while maintaining security boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want CORS support so that my browser-based applications can access the Solid pod from different domains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN web applications make cross-origin requests THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CORS headers
2. WHEN preflight requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle OPTIONS requests correctly
3. WHEN CORS policies are configured THEN the system SHALL enforce allowed origins, methods, and headers
4. WHEN requests are blocked THEN the system SHALL provide clear CORS error responses
5. IF CORS configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject requests with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want configurable CORS policies so that I can control which applications can access my pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring CORS THEN the system SHALL support allowlist of trusted origins
2. WHEN setting policies THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of permitted HTTP methods
3. WHEN managing access THEN the system SHALL support custom header allowlists
4. WHEN security is important THEN the system SHALL provide restrictive default CORS settings
5. IF unauthorized origins attempt access THEN the system SHALL block requests and log attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want CORS security controls so that cross-origin access doesn't compromise pod security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL properly manage Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate origin headers against configured policies
3. WHEN CORS violations occur THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
4. WHEN wildcard origins are used THEN the system SHALL warn about security implications
5. IF credential-bearing requests use wildcards THEN the system SHALL reject them for security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper preflight handling so that complex cross-origin requests work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preflight requests are received THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate allowed methods
2. WHEN custom headers are used THEN the system SHALL include them in Access-Control-Allow-Headers
3. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL set appropriate Access-Control-Max-Age values
4. WHEN preflight checks fail THEN the system SHALL return clear error responses
5. IF preflight requirements aren't met THEN the system SHALL prevent the actual request

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want seamless web application access so that CORS doesn't interfere with my application usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using web applications THEN CORS SHALL be transparent to the user experience
2. WHEN applications make requests THEN the system SHALL minimize preflight request overhead
3. WHEN multiple applications are used THEN CORS SHALL support concurrent cross-origin access
4. WHEN applications update THEN CORS SHALL adapt to new request patterns automatically
5. IF CORS issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages in developer tools

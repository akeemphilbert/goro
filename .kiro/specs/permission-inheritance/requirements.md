# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Permission Inheritance system implements hierarchical permission propagation throughout the Solid pod's container structure. This feature enables efficient permission management by allowing permissions set on parent containers to automatically apply to child resources while supporting granular overrides when needed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want automatic permission inheritance so that I don't have to set permissions on every individual resource.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers have ACLs THEN child resources SHALL automatically inherit parent permissions
2. WHEN creating new resources THEN they SHALL inherit permissions from their parent container
3. WHEN moving resources THEN they SHALL adopt the permissions of their new parent container
4. WHEN inheritance is active THEN the system SHALL apply the most restrictive combination of inherited permissions
5. IF no parent permissions exist THEN the system SHALL apply secure default permissions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a resource owner, I want to override inherited permissions so that I can set specific access rules for individual resources when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting explicit ACLs THEN they SHALL override inherited permissions for that specific resource
2. WHEN overriding permissions THEN the system SHALL maintain inheritance for non-overridden permission types
3. WHEN removing explicit ACLs THEN resources SHALL revert to inherited permissions
4. WHEN overrides conflict with inheritance THEN explicit permissions SHALL take precedence
5. IF override validation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain existing permissions and report errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want permission inheritance monitoring so that I can understand effective permissions throughout the pod hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing permissions THEN the system SHALL provide tools to visualize effective permissions
2. WHEN inheritance changes THEN the system SHALL log permission propagation events
3. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL show both inherited and explicit permissions
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide permission resolution traces
5. IF inheritance creates security issues THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest corrections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient inheritance resolution so that permission checking remains fast even in deep hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resolving permissions THEN the system SHALL complete inheritance calculation in milliseconds
2. WHEN hierarchies are deep THEN the system SHALL optimize permission resolution algorithms
3. WHEN permissions are frequently checked THEN the system SHALL cache inheritance calculations
4. WHEN inheritance changes THEN the system SHALL invalidate affected cache entries efficiently
5. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain security while optimizing inheritance resolution

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want inheritance flexibility so that I can implement complex sharing scenarios across different parts of my pod.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing data THEN the system SHALL support different inheritance policies for different container branches
2. WHEN sharing collections THEN inheritance SHALL work correctly with group permissions and public access
3. WHEN managing projects THEN the system SHALL support inheritance blocking to prevent unwanted permission propagation
4. WHEN permissions are complex THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation of effective permissions
5. IF inheritance becomes too complex THEN the system SHALL provide tools to simplify permission structures

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Container Management system provides hierarchical organization of resources in the Solid pod, implementing the Linked Data Platform (LDP) container model. This feature enables users to logically group related resources, navigate data structures, and manage collections of resources efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to organize my data in folders so that I can logically group related resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating containers THEN the system SHALL support nested hierarchical structures
2. WHEN accessing containers THEN the system SHALL list contained resources and sub-containers
3. WHEN organizing data THEN containers SHALL support both RDF and binary resources
4. WHEN navigating structures THEN the system SHALL provide parent-child relationships
5. IF container creation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want LDP-compliant containers so that my Solid applications work with standard protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing containers THEN the system SHALL follow LDP BasicContainer specifications
2. WHEN listing contents THEN containers SHALL return proper LDP membership triples
3. WHEN creating resources THEN containers SHALL automatically update membership information
4. WHEN deleting resources THEN containers SHALL remove membership references
5. IF LDP operations are invalid THEN the system SHALL return standard LDP error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want efficient container operations so that browsing large collections is fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN listing container contents THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large collections
2. WHEN accessing containers THEN the system SHALL provide efficient membership queries
3. WHEN searching within containers THEN the system SHALL support filtering and sorting
4. WHEN containers grow large THEN performance SHALL remain acceptable (sub-second response)
5. IF memory usage becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL use streaming for large listings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want container metadata so that I can track creation dates, sizes, and other properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are created THEN the system SHALL record creation timestamps
2. WHEN containers change THEN the system SHALL update modification timestamps
3. WHEN querying containers THEN the system SHALL provide size and member count information
4. WHEN accessing metadata THEN the system SHALL include standard Dublin Core properties
5. IF metadata is corrupted THEN the system SHALL regenerate it from current state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want container discovery so that applications can navigate the pod structure programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exploring containers THEN the system SHALL provide machine-readable structure information
2. WHEN navigating hierarchies THEN the system SHALL support breadcrumb and path resolution
3. WHEN discovering resources THEN containers SHALL expose type information for contents
4. WHEN building UIs THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient metadata for rendering
5. IF navigation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options

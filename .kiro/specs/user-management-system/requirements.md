# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The User Management System provides comprehensive user account lifecycle management for the Solid pod, including account creation, profile management, user administration, and account deactivation. This feature enables pod administrators to manage users while giving users control over their own accounts and data.



## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating accounts THEN the system SHALL support user registration with WebID creation and validation
2. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL provide administrative interfaces for user account operations
3. WHEN users request changes THEN the system SHALL support account modification, suspension, and reactivation
4. WHEN accounts are deleted THEN the system SHALL handle data cleanup and access revocation properly
5. IF account operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want to manage my own profile so that I can control my personal information and account settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating profiles THEN users SHALL be able to modify their personal information and preferences
2. WHEN managing privacy THEN users SHALL control visibility of profile information and data sharing settings
3. WHEN changing credentials THEN users SHALL be able to update passwords and authentication methods
4. WHEN managing data THEN users SHALL have access to their data export and deletion options
5. IF profile changes conflict THEN the system SHALL validate changes and prevent invalid configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want account-based user organization so that I can manage users within my pod's account structure and control access through role-based invitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a pod THEN the system SHALL associate it with a primary account concept
2. WHEN inviting users THEN the system SHALL allow account owners to send invitations with assigned roles
3. WHEN users accept invitations THEN the system SHALL grant appropriate permissions based on assigned roles
4. WHEN managing account membership THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces to view and modify user roles
5. IF invitation conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL validate role assignments and prevent unauthorized access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to link my WebID to external identity providers so that I can authenticate using existing accounts from Google, Microsoft, or other trusted providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linking identities THEN the system SHALL support OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration with external providers
2. WHEN authenticating THEN users SHALL be able to sign in using linked external accounts
3. WHEN managing linked accounts THEN users SHALL be able to add, remove, and view connected identity providers
4. WHEN identity linking fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback authentication options
5. IF external provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL maintain alternative authentication methods 

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account so that I can create my own WebID and start using the pod services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering THEN the system SHALL collect required user information and validate input
2. WHEN creating WebID THEN the system SHALL generate a unique WebID URI for the new user
3. WHEN completing registration THEN the system SHALL create user profile and initialize account settings
4. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and allow retry
5. IF WebID conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL generate alternative identifiers and notify the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete my own account and close it permanently so that I can remove my data and terminate my access when I no longer need the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting account deletion THEN the system SHALL provide a secure self-service deletion process
2. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation and authentication
3. WHEN processing deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all user data, resources, and access permissions
4. WHEN deletion completes THEN the system SHALL invalidate all user sessions and authentication tokens
5. IF deletion fails THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want scalable user management so that the system can handle growth and maintain performance with many users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scaling users THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with increasing user counts
2. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL provide user quotas and resource allocation controls
3. WHEN handling load THEN the system SHALL support efficient user lookup and authentication operations
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL provide user management analytics and optimization recommendations
5. IF capacity limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and capacity planning guidance

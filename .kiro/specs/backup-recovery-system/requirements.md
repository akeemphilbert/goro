# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Backup & Recovery System provides comprehensive data protection and disaster recovery capabilities for the Solid pod. This feature ensures user data is safely backed up, can be restored in case of failures, and maintains data integrity across backup and recovery operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pod owner, I want automatic backups so that my users' data is protected against hardware failures, corruption, and accidental deletion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are scheduled THEN the system SHALL perform automatic backups at configurable intervals
2. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency and integrity during backup operations
3. WHEN backups complete THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and completeness
4. WHEN backup storage is managed THEN the system SHALL support retention policies and automatic cleanup of old backups
5. IF backup operations fail THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pod user, I want point-in-time recovery so that I can restore my data to a specific moment if something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL support restoration to any available backup point
2. WHEN performing recovery THEN the system SHALL maintain data relationships and access control settings
3. WHEN restoring data THEN the system SHALL provide options for full pod restoration or selective resource recovery
4. WHEN recovery completes THEN the system SHALL verify restored data integrity and consistency
5. IF recovery operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and alternative recovery options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want encrypted backups so that backed-up data remains secure even if backup storage is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL encrypt backup data using strong encryption algorithms
2. WHEN managing encryption THEN the system SHALL support key rotation and secure key management
3. WHEN storing backups THEN the system SHALL support multiple backup destinations (local, cloud, remote)
4. WHEN accessing backups THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication and authorization
5. IF encryption keys are compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for re-encryption and key recovery

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pod administrator, I want backup monitoring so that I can ensure backup operations are working correctly and data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring backups THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing backup status, success rates, and storage usage
2. WHEN backup issues occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts and notifications to administrators
3. WHEN analyzing backup health THEN the system SHALL provide reports on backup performance and reliability
4. WHEN testing recovery THEN the system SHALL support backup validation and recovery testing procedures
5. IF backup systems fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics and recovery recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want backup auditing so that I can demonstrate data protection compliance and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN maintaining compliance THEN the system SHALL log all backup and recovery operations with detailed audit trails
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide compliance reports showing backup coverage and retention
3. WHEN managing data lifecycle THEN the system SHALL support legal hold and data retention policies
4. WHEN auditing access THEN the system SHALL track who accessed backups and when
5. IF compliance requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt backup policies to meet new regulatory standards

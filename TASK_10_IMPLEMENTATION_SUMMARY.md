### 2. Comprehensive Step Definitions

**`container_step_definitions_test.go`** - Complete BDD step definitions implementing:

- **Container Context Management**: Full test context with HTTP server, repositories, and event tracking
- **HTTP Test Server**: Mock LDP-compliant endpoints for container operations
- **Event Simulation**: Event creation, tracking, and verification

- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and throughput measurement

### 3. Integration Test Suites

**`container_comprehensive_integration_test.go`** - Integration tests using step definitions:

#### Container Creation and Hierarchy Management
- Basic container creation with validation
- Nested container hierarchies with parent-child relationships
- Deep hierarchy navigation and path resolution
- Circular reference prevention

- Mixed content type handling and proper classification
- Automatic membership updates on resource creation/deletion
- LDP membership triple generation in multiple formats

#### Container HTTP API Compliance
- GET container with member listing and content negotiation

- OPTIONS for supported methods discovery
- Comprehensive error handling (404, 409, 405)

#### Performance and Large Collections
- Large container pagination (1000+ resources) with sub-second response
- Member filtering and sorting capabilities
- Streaming large container listings (10000+ resources) with constant memory
- Concurrent container access with no race conditions
- Container size caching with invalidation
- Deep hierarchy navigation performance optimization
- Bulk operations with efficient indexing

#### Concurrency and Race Conditions
- Concurrent container creation with proper conflict resolution
- Concurrent resource addition/removal with consistency guarantees
- Membership update race conditions with atomic operations
- Container deletion race conditions with safe handling
- Hierarchy modification concurrency with integrity preservation
- Membership index consistency under load testing
- Metadata update serialization with no lost updates
- Event processing under concurrency with ordering guarantees

#### Event Processing
- Container lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted) with proper payloads
- Member addition/removal events with relationship tracking
- Event ordering and consistency with chronological guarantees
- Event handler processing with failure isolation
- Event replay capability for state reconstruction
- Event filtering and querying with performance optimization
- Concurrent event processing with no loss or duplication

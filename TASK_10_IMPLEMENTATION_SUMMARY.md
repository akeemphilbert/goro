#### Repository Integration Tests
- **GORM Repository Implementations**: Tests all repository implementations with temporary SQLite database
- **CRUD Operations**: Comprehensive testing of Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- **Relationship Queries**: Tests complex queries involving user-account-role relationships
- **Data Integrity**: Verifies foreign key constraints and data consistency

#### Atomic Entity Relationships
- **Event Projections**: Tests that membership data is correctly projected from domain events
- **Relationship Consistency**: Verifies that account-member-role relationships remain consistent
- **Cross-Entity Queries**: Tests queries that span multiple entities and their relationships

### 10.2 End-to-End HTTP Workflow Tests ✅

Created comprehensive HTTP workflow tests that verify:

#### User Management HTTP Workflows
- **User Registration via HTTP**: Tests complete registration workflow through HTTP endpoints
- **Profile Updates via HTTP**: Tests profile modification through PUT requests
- **User Deletion via HTTP**: Tests account deletion with proper confirmation requirements
- **Error Handling**: Tests various error scenarios and proper HTTP status codes

#### Account Management HTTP Workflows
- **Account Creation via HTTP**: Tests account creation through HTTP endpoints
- **Invitation Management**: Tests invitation creation and acceptance via HTTP
- **Member Role Updates**: Tests role modification through HTTP endpoints
- **Validation and Error Responses**: Tests input validation and error handling

#### Authentication and Authorization Tests
- **Authentication Requirements**: Tests that protected endpoints require valid authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Tests that users can only perform actions allowed by their roles
- **Resource Access Control**: Tests that users can only access their own resources
- **Token Validation**: Tests handling of invalid, expired, and malformed tokens

#### Error Scenario Testing
- **Invalid JSON Handling**: Tests proper error responses for malformed requests
- **Missing Required Fields**: Tests validation error responses
- **Resource Not Found**: Tests 404 error handling
- **Permission Denied**: Tests 403 error responses for unauthorized actions

## Key Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure
- **Temporary Databases**: Uses in-memory SQLite for isolated test execution
- **File Storage Testing**: Custom test file storage implementation for user data
- **HTTP Server Mocking**: Complete HTTP server setup with middleware for realistic testing
- **Authentication Simulation**: Test authentication middleware for protected endpoint testing

### Test Coverage Areas
1. **Domain Layer**: Entity creation, validation, and business logic
2. **Application Layer**: Service orchestration and use case execution
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations and external integrations
4. **Transport Layer**: HTTP handlers, middleware, and error responses
5. **Integration Points**: Database persistence, file storage, and event handling

### Test Data Management
- **Unique Identifiers**: Uses timestamp-based IDs to avoid test conflicts
- **Isolated Environments**: Each test uses separate temporary directories and databases
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Proper cleanup of test resources after execution
- **Realistic Data**: Uses realistic test data that matches production scenarios
